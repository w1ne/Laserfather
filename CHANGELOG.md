# Changelog

All notable changes to LaserFather.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-01-23

### Added
We added a lot in this first release!

**PWA Support**
The app works offline and you can install it on your device.

**Machine Selection**
Supports GRBL 1.1+ based laser cutters. This includes most Diode and CO2 lasers.

**Design Workspace**
You can import SVG vectors and Raster images like PNG or JPG. We added basic primitives like rectangles. You can manage layers and move or scale items.

**CAM Engine**
G-code generation happens locally in your browser so it is fast and private. You can configure cuts, vector engraves, or raster engraves. Save your favorite settings to the Material Library.

**Machine Control**
Connect directly to your laser using USB. We use the Web Serial API for this. You have full Jog controls plus Homing and Unlock. The position updates in real-time.

**Android Support**
We added a polyfill so you can connect from Android phones using an OTG cable.

**UI**
The Properties panel now rounds numbers nicely. We added an About dialog with links to the source code. You can also buy me a coffee if you like!

**Documentation**
New README with a setup guide. We also documented the architecture and roadmap.

**License**
Released under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

### Fixed
We fixed a crash on non-secure HTTP sites regarding `crypto.randomUUID`.
The Properties panel no longer shows messy numbers with too many decimal places.
The build config was fixed to work with relative paths.

### Changed
G-code generation is now separate from streaming. This makes the workflow smoother.
We updated the project structure for better organization.
